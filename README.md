## ⚠️ How to Run the Game Properly

To ensure the executable (`.exe`) works correctly and all graphic and level resources are loaded, it **must be executed from the original root folder of the project**, where the `resources/` and `levels/` folders are located.

If you wish to move the `.exe` to another location, make sure to **also copy the `resources/` and `levels/` folders into the same directory**. The minimum required structure should look like this:
```
📁 YourChosenFolder
├── The-Journey-of-the-Prairie-King.exe
├── resources/
└── levels/
```

Otherwise, images and other resources will not load properly and the game may not display correctly.
